* <strong> NOTE:</strong> Use these sample exams as additional practice and anticipation of what kind of questions may be asked on the midterm exam. Some exams may contain questions we have not covered yet or will be in the scope of the Midterm Exam (please refer to the lecture material for the breadth of topics covered in the exams). I encourage everyone to work through the problems, but <b>DO NOT</b> base your studying only on these exams. I expect all students to review the material thoroughly.
