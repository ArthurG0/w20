  <b> Robert McLaughlin (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Robert (he/him/his) and I am one of your TAs for this quarter! I am a first-year PhD student interested in distributed and dynamical systems. I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology in NY, and most recently spent one year working at Microsoft building Azure. I am passionate about teaching: I spent four years as a volunteer tutor at RIT, and served as president of the Society of Software Engineers, a student mentoring organization. Outside of the classroom I run, bike, hike, boulder, and read philosophy! Please feel free to come and chat with me. Have a great quarter!" </i>

    <b>Arthur Gatin (Lead Tutor)</b>
    <i> "Hi, I'm Arthur, and I'm a second year Computer Science student. I took CS32 with Professor Wang last quarter in Spring, so I remember very well how this class was run and what you can expect to encounter in it. This quarter I'm taking three computer science courses, so, hopefully, will be able not only to explain the concepts in the way I understood them best when I took the class, but also tell you which ones will be particularly important for your next CS courses. I'm also a program lead of the Tutoring program for this quarter, so feel free to offer your feedback on your experiences with the program, or anything of the kind :). Apart from that, I'm currently running for a hall council position in Manzanita, trying to get more involved in hackathons and clubs like UCSB Robotics, IEEE, and Data Science (join me), and play games. Have 1200+ hours in Rocket League, and recently started getting better at Smash Ultimate. Feel free to talk to me and ask anything in sections, open labs, piazza, or even IRL. Hope we have a fantastic quarter together!" </i>

    <b>Xilin Wang (Tutor) </b>
    <i> "Hello everyone, welcome to CS32! I am Xilin Wang. Xilin pronounces similar to "she lin". But you can always call me Wayne. I will be your mentor in this quarter and I hope that with my help, you not only get a satisfactory grade at the end, but more importantly, master more advanced skills in C++ that can benefit your future career. A little bit about myself: I am from China and this is year number five for me in the states; I am a third year computer science major; I like to play video games and basketball during my spare time. The reason that I want to be a mentor is because I received lots of help from the mentors when I was in your situation. I still remember vividly the feeling of relief when a mentor sits next to me helping me debug something that puzzled me for days. I wouldn't have succeeded in all those difficult computer science courses without help from mentors, tutors, and TAs. And now, it is my turn to use my knowledge to help you succeed. I had CS32 with Professor Richert a year ago and therefore I am very familiar with his teaching style. I will try my best to share my experience with you about how to do well in his class, including how to incorporating textbook with class notes, how to approach labs and homework, and how to properly prepare for exams. Please don't feel shy, ask me anything about course related material. Not just labs, I am happy to address any doubts you have. The only one advice I would give you is to go to office hours and make use of them. Talk with people, whether your professors or TAs, about your questions and concerns. It is so much more efficient than work things out on your own. If you cannot make it to office hour, you can always ask on piazza. Please don't leave your doubts unsolved. It makes us feel like we fail at our jobs. All in all, I am happy to meet all you guys and I hope we can work things through and have a wonderful quarter together!" </i>

  <b> Grace Zhang (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Grace, my preferred pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am a second year Computer Engineering major. This is first time tutoring for a CS class, and I really look forward to it! CS32 is my favorite CS course I have taken at UCSB so far. Even though the topics in this course are interesting, but some of them were quite hard to grasp such as threads. When I was taking CS32, the professor and tutors were extremely helpful in guiding me to fully understand what I didnâ€™t know. Without their immense help, I wouldn't have succeed in this course. Additionally, always knowing that there is someone out there to help definitely enhanced my experience in taking CS32. I hope that I will be able to help you just like how I was being helped. I know how frustrating it is when something does not make sense, so please do not hesitate to ask questions. I will try my best to answer all of them. I lived in China for six years and moved back to U.S. during middle school. During my free time, I love watching YouTube videos. Most videos I watch are usually eating shows since I am always craving for food. Some eating shows are also quite relaxing to watch: there is this YouTuber called Stephanie Soo who would do story times as she eats, and I find this quite entertaining. Besides from watching YouTube videos, I also love watching Marvel movies. I have been a fan of them ever since the first Iron Man movie came out. I also enjoy Kpop a lot. My current favorite groups are NCT and SuperM. Please feel free to reach out to me during open lab hours to ask questions about the course material, study tips, other lower division courses, or just to talk! I look forward to having a great quarter with everyone. :)" </i>
